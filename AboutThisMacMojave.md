In this brief guide, I will explain how to perform three modifications to the 'About This Mac' panel under Mac OS X 10.14 Mojave.  You will learn how to replace the system image, edit the "macOS Mojave" text and change the model displayed for your SMBIOS.

You will require the following tools:

- iHex
- ThemeEngine
- Image Editor (Optional but recommended)
